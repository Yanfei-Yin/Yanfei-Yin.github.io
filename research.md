  <i>Abstract: In this paper, we use cohort difference-in-differences method to identify the impacts of the national and local pilot models of the Chinese Nutrition Improvement Program on the high school enrollment, and then conduct a comparative analysis of the two models. We find that the national and local pilot models have their own advantages and disadvantages and complement each other. The policy effects of the local pilot model are confounded by local fiscal capacity and local officials’ preferences. While the national pilot model avoids this shortcoming, it is less cost-effective than local pilots. Therefore, at the city level, a combination of national and local pilots can achieve more significant policy effects than a one-size-fits-all approach that utilizes a single national or local pilot in all counties.</i>

  <i>Abstract: How do wars affect the state's choice between direct and indirect governance? Using the 70-year Dzungar-Qing Wars (1688-1758) as an exogenous shock and a difference-in-differences strategy on prefecture-level panel data, we reveal that for the Qing Empire, war-unaffected regions rich in strategic military resources were more likely to shift from local autonomy to direct governance after the wars broke out. This permanent governance reform was more likely to occur where transportation was more convenient, while resource-rich areas opened more factories during rather than after the wars. Thus, the paper highlights the regional externality in state building during wartime.</i>

<p>
  <i>Abstract: We examine the intergenerational impact of China's 1950s adult literacy campaign, the largest anti-illiteracy effort in history, reaching 150 million people. While direct effects on adult literacy have been criticized, we document significant long-term benefits for the next generation's education. Using an original dataset compiled from county gazetteers and population census, we find a notable increase in educational attainment for children of parents exposed to the campaign. We attribute these results to extensive government propaganda that likely shifted population attitudes towards education. Our findings suggest that literacy campaigns can be a viable strategy in developing countries with limited state capacity.</i>

  <i>Abstract: Many early human societies suffered from catastrophic floods during their development. Using the deluge of the Yellow River around 1920 BCE as a natural experiment, we show that the deluge accelerated early societal development, measured by class differentiation, public buildings, the use of bronze, evidence of writing, and early cities. Regarding possible channels, we show that higher soil productivity and increased cooperation post-deluge – rather than increased conflict – jointly contributed to development, with no single force dominating the other. Therefore, the paper highlights multiple interactive contributors to early societal development.</i>

<p>
  <i>Abstract: This paper traces and analyzes the change in ownership of art masterpieces over multiple centuries by merging collector information from 50,496 collection stamps with artwork information from 9,396 traditional Chinese art masterpieces spanning the Song to the Qing dynasties. The analysis reveals three findings. First, qualitatively, the social class of collectors declined continuously within the same dynasty, but masterpieces were re-centralized in the hands of top political elites after dynastic changes. Second, empirically, masterpieces increasingly flowed from higher to lower social classes in regions with higher social mobility. Third, the ownership of art masterpieces shifted from political elites (high-ranking bureaucrats) to economic elites (wealthy civilians). The results are robust when controlling for political turmoil, governance instability, and social unrest. This research provides a new perspective on social mobility, wealth distribution and inequality in pre-modern societies.</i>

  <i>Abstract: Research funding is critical for fostering innovation, but its effectiveness depends on the right balance between oversight and flexibility. Using China's 2012 funding system reform as a natural experiment, we explore how increased funding stringency affects academic productivity and behaviors by analyzing both publication data and survey responses from Chinese economic scholars. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between regulation and productivity: moderate oversight improves publication quantity and quality, while excessive control may diminish productivity by imposing administrative burdens. The reform fostered greater collaboration and conference participation, yet higher compliance costs led to the underutilization of research funds and discouraged some scholars from seeking new funding. These results highlight the trade-off between accountability and efficiency in research funding systems, providing critical insights for policymakers aiming to design frameworks that ensure proper fund use without hindering innovation.</i>

  6. <b>Decentralized Energy-saving Target Allocation: Allocation Efficiency and Emission Reduction Effect.</b> (in Chinese) (with Gang Jin), <b>Submitted</b> (The authors contributed equally to this work and were ordered alphabetically)

<p>
  <i>Abstract: The allocation of energy saving targets from government to firms is a key part of the binding energy saving policy. However, how to optimize the allocation of energy-saving targets from government to firms has not yet received attention from existing studies. This paper investigates the allocation efficiency and consequences of decentralized energy-saving target allocation based on the Top 10,000 energy saving program in China. It is found that decentralized allocation can allocate relatively more energy-saving targets to firms with higher energy intensity, thus improving the allocation efficiency. The mechanism behind this is that lower-level governments have more private information about firms' energy-saving potential. Further discussion reveals that decentralized target allocation makes it easier for firms to meet their energy-saving targets and avoids aggressive production cuts; on the other hand, it can generate significant carbon reduction effects and curb the negative economic shocks generated by carbon reduction.</i>
