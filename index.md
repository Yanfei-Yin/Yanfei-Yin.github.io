  Welcome to my website! I am Yanfei Yin, a third-year masters student at School of Business, Nanjing University.
<p>

<p>  
  My research interests are development economics, political economy, and economic history. Specifically, my research aims to gain a deep understanding of the relationship between central and local governments and their strategic interactions, including the determinants of the governance method, and the impact of the reform of local government power. I am also interested in using unique data to measure social mobility in pre-modern societies, as well as discussing human capital formation and the spillover effects of education using census data and household survey data.
