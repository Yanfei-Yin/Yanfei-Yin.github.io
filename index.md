  Welcome to my website! I am Yanfei Yin, a third-year masters student at School of Business, Nanjing University.
<p>

<p>  
  My research interests lie in development economics, political economy, and economic history. Specifically, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of power distribution across different levels of government in China, including the determinants of governance methods and the impacts of local government power reforms. Additionally, I am interested in using unique data to measure social mobility in pre-modern societies, as well as exploring human capital formation and the spillover effects of education through census data and household survey data.
